    <p <strong>Ronald Wilson Reagan was an American politician and actor who served as the 40th President of the United States from 1981 to 1989. Before his presidency, he was the 33rd Governor of California, from 1967 to 1975, after a career as a Hollywood actor and union leader.

Raised in a poor family in small towns of northern Illinois, Reagan graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and worked as a sports announcer on several regional radio stations. After moving to Hollywood in 1937, he became an actor and starred in a few major productions. Reagan was twice elected President of the Screen Actors Guild—the labor union for actors—where he worked to root out Communist influence. In the 1950s, he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at General Electric factories. Reagan had always been a Democrat until 1962 when he became a conservative and switched to the Republican Party. In 1964, Reagan's speech, "A Time for Choosing", supported Barry Goldwater's floundering presidential campaign and earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman. Building a network of supporters, he was elected Governor of California in 1966. As governor, Reagan raised taxes, turned a state budget deficit to a surplus, challenged the protesters at the University of California, ordered National Guard troops in during a period of protest movements in 1969, and was re-elected in 1970. He twice ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for the U.S. presidency in 1968 and 1976; four years later, he easily won the nomination outright, becoming the oldest elected U.S. president up to that time, defeating incumbent Jimmy Carter in 1980.

<p><center>Ronald Reagans presidency was full of many noteable events. Here is a timeline of some of those events.</center></p>

<ul>
  <li><b>January 20th, 1981-</b>Ronald Reagan is sworn in as the 40th President of the United States. In his inaugural address, Reagan declares that "Government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem."</li>
  <li><b>March 30th, 1981-</b>Ronald Reagan is shot by a deranged would-be assassin named John Hinckley, who hopes –bizarrely—that killing the president will win him the affections of Hollywood actress Jodie Foster. Reagan takes a bullet to the chest, the shell passing within one inch his heart, but goes on to make a speedy recovery.</li>
  <li><b>July 29th, 1981-</b>Congress passes President Reagan's tax bill, slashing income tax rates by 25% across the board.</li>
  <li><b>September, 1981-</b>Sandra Day O'Connor,the first female supreme court justice, is appointed.</li>
  <li><b>1982-</b>The United States endures its worst economic recession since the Great Depression. For the first time since the 1930s, the American unemployment rate exceeds 10%. President Reagan's approval ratings fall to an all-time low of 35%.</li>
  <li><b>March 23rd, 1983-</b>In a nationally televised address, President Reagan unveils his Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposal to build space-based lasers capable of shooting down incoming nuclear missiles. The press will later label the futuristic and expensive plan "Star Wars."</li>
  <li><b>August 25th, 1983-</b>The United States invades the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada, overthrowing the country's Marxist dictatorship.</li>
  <li><b>October, 1984</b>Congress passes a law banning the diversion of US government funds to support Nicaragua's anticommunist Contra rebels. The Reagan Administration violates the new law, eventually leading to the Iran-Contra Crisis of 1986-87.</li>
  <li><b>November 4th, 1984-</b>Ronald Reagan wins a second term as president, defeating Democratic challenger Walter Mondale in another electoral landslide. Reagan wins 59% of the popular vote and every state but Mondale's home of Minnesota. One out of every four registered Democrats crosses party lines to vote for Reagan.</li>
  <p><center>Those were just some events and only from his first term. I highly suggest reading more about one of our greatest presidents
